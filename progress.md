How to preprocess raw dataset CSVs into NumPy arrays for efficient training.

Normalization of image pixel values to the 0â€“1 range for stable neural network training.

Using train-test split with stratification to preserve class balance.

How to save and load .npy files for fast I/O in ML pipelines.

Visualizing random image samples with labels to sanity-check preprocessing.

Base Line and Augmented show healthy learning curve but accuracy can be improved.

Record baseline vs augmented performance (test accuracy).

Note validation accuracy improvement with checkpointing.
